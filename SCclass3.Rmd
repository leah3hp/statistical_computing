  ##Array: a data structure
         -how to initialize-x=array(0, dim=c(2, 2, 2)) 
         check the dim- dim(x)
         access array element- x[1,1,1] will give you first element of each dim
                               x[1:2, 1 ,1 ] will give 1st 2 elements of first dim and 1st of 2nd and 3rd
                               x=array(0,dim=c(2,2))
                               colmanes(x)=c("v1", "v2")
                               x[,"v1"]
         fxns- x +- y x*/y element wise 
              for matrix: x%*%y and the dim has to match - nxm and mxl
              t(x) - transpose det(x)- determinant solve(x)- inverse 
              roeSum(x) or colSum(x) row/colMeans(x)
 ##List: a data structure to store all types of data together
        -initilization: my.list=list(v1=x1, v2=y) v2 and v1 can have different structures (logicals and               numerics that dont need same length or dim)
        -access: my.list[1]-location 1 and gives name,  my.list[[1]], my.list$v1 is best way 
        -get rid: my.list$v1=NULL
        -add: my.list$v4=[ ]
  ##Data frame: data structure somewhere between a list and array
            - initialize: a.df=data.frame(v1=x, v2=y v3=z)- all have to have same # of rows but any type 
            -access: a.df[1,2], cols by names a.df$v1, a.df[,"v1"]
            - widely used in many packages 
            -can trans df into matrix or vise-versa 
            -expand: b.df by add a col or row 
                    b.df=data.frame(a.df, v4=m) col
                    c.df=rbind(a.df, list(v1=3 (numbers), v2=TRUE (logicals), v3="s" (characters)))

#Today
```
#ITERATION

 ##Index vectors, mats, lists: with integers, booleans, names
 ##if-else
 ##Iteration- for , while, repeat 
 
 #see lecture notes 
 
 #IF-ELSE: if then else 
  see noted for structure 
  nested: if (x>0){
            if(x<10){}
              else{}
          }else{}
  
  switch: helpful when there are many options 
  ex) x.vec=c()
        if (typesum=="mean"){y=mean(x.vec)}
        else if (typesum=="median"){y=median(x.vec)}
        else if (typesu,=="histogram"){hist(x.vec)}
        else{print("i dont understand")}
          so switch would be less complicated 
  for loops-2 compontents and inefficient in R for large loops
           -lessens your actions and code since it is looping
  while loops- 2 compontents and more general
            - continue to carry out with satisfying conditions 
            - if always true it will always run and you will have to force stop
